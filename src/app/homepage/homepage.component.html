        After dedicating a decade to emergency medical services (EMS), spanning diverse roles from bustling urban environments to helicopter operations and rural settings, including urgent care, I felt the urge for a new challenge. Inspired by a friend's transition from EMS to software development, I delved into the world of coding and found it immensely enjoyable.
        <br />
        <br />
        The thrill of encountering a problem, getting stuck, and then successfully resolving it captivated me. Motivated to pursue a new career path, I returned to school and earned my Associates in Computer Science. Subsequently, I enrolled in an online coding boot camp specializing in Java, Vue.js, and Spring.
        <br />
        <br />
        I discovered a particular affinity for object-oriented programmingâ€”finding satisfaction in crafting individual pieces of code that seamlessly come together. Since March 2022, I've been thriving as a junior full-stack developer, engaging with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET, Vue.js, Classic ASP, VBScript, SQL, and Razor.
        <br />
        <br />
        As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am eager to continue growing as a professional full-stack software developer.
